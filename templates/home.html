    <h3>What's going on here?</h3>
    <p>This is a project that uses collaborative filtering to find the best board games for you to try based on how you -- and other people <i>like</i> you -- have rated thousands of games on BoardGameGeek.com. </p>
    <p>I created this recommender as my capstone project for a Data Science training program at <a href ="https://www.galvanize.com">Galvanize</a></p>
    <p>I'm rolling out the recommender for a short beta test ahead of my final presentation. I pledge all proceeds raised during this beta period to <a href ="https://extra-life.org">Extra Life</a>, a game-focussed charity that raises money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>
    <p>If you like what I'm doing here (or if you think there's something I could do better) please let me know. You can find a feedback form on the recommendations page.</p>
